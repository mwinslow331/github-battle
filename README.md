This is a web application built through instructions on https://tylermcginnis.com/ but refactored to ES6 during the course. This was built with React.js using React -v 16, React Router 4 and webpack -v 3.

We used the Github API to compile user data into a single page application. The hosting site is firebase and is available at the following:
https://github-battle-9db8c.firebaseapp.com/.

The purpose of taking this course was to further my understanding on how webpack worked in the background and ease the transition from the development phase to build stage. 

I am currently in the process of writing tests for 90% coverage and will be expanding and modifiying the code base for additional features. Tests are written with Enzyme and Jest.
